# syntlog â€” internal

This document contains information for contributors.

## prerequisites

Install `pipenv` and run `pipenv install`.

### installing new dependencies

Use `pipenv` to install new dependencies. We can install dependencies from repositories. For example:

    pipenv install -e git+https://bitbucket.org/problog/problog.git#egg=problog

will install ProbLog from BitBucket.

## folder structure

The `synthlog` root folder contains all core modulesâ€”which are automatically loaded in `synthlog.pl`â€”and utilities. Other modules, such as `synthlog.predict` and `synthlog.wrangle`, get their own folder.

```plaintext
|-- docs                    % generated by sphinx
'-- synthlog                % main synthlog module
    |-- __init__.py
    |-- __main__.py         % cli entry point
    |-- synthlog.pl         % default synthlog environment
    |-- core.py             % core synthlog predicates/builtins
    |
    |-- python              % bridges between syntlog and python
    |   '-- matrix.py       %   converting between synthlog objects
    |                       %   and matrices
    |
    |-- wrangle             %
    |   |-- transformations.py
    |   |-- heuristics.py
    |   |-- wrangle.py      % Until support for __init__.py module
    |                       % loading is added, import this one.
    |
    |-- predict
    |
    |-- autocomplete
    |-- ...
```

For now, we include modules as `:- use_module('wrangle/wrangle.py')`, but soon we'll hopefully be able to simply do `:- use_module('wrangle')`.

## style guide

Please (please) try to adhere to the following guidelinesâ€”we want to have something that we should not be ashamed about to release. ðŸ˜…

### code

* Use `black` for formatting. It should be installed with pipenv and most editors
  should be compatible with it, and should make sure that most linters are happy.

### documentation

We use Sphinx to generate documentationâ€”which works best when adhering to the following guidelines.

* Use [Google style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
* Use `pydocstyle` and `pep8` for linting.
